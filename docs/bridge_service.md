# Bridge service component

The bridge service abstracts interaction with the unified LxLy bridge. It represents decentralized indexer, that sequences the bridge data. Each bridge service sequences L1 network and a dedicated L2 one (which is uniquely defined by the network id parameter). It is implemented as a JSON RPC service.

## Endpoints
This paragraph explains a set of endpoints, that are providing indexed bridge data.
